## What is checked

A text element lies outside its SVG's viewport and is not drawn.

## Why

The second rule carrying `error`. Two directly measured boxes, a structural boundary. Both are normalised through `getScreenCTM()` before comparison: `getBBox()` returns local coordinates, and on a transformed group local (60, 0) is absolute (284.57, 70.78) — an error of 235.46 px. Comparing a local box against an absolute viewport is a different measurement, not an approximation.

## Limits and known false alarms

With `overflow: visible` the glyphs are painted after all, and the rule declines rather than reports.

## Calibration

`calibrated: false`. The threshold has not been fitted to a corpus of real documents with
human-checked truth; no such corpus exists for this project. Every finding says so, and the
report says so in `measurement.calibrated`. That is the honest state, not a defect — but it is
also why this rule ships with the severity it has.

M3-0 classifies this rule as `structural-validation`, not empirical threshold optimisation. The lab
reproduces outside, enlarged-viewBox and `overflow: visible` cases against an independent geometry
implementation and then exercises the unchanged production decision. The zero boundary is
unchanged, and `calibrated: false` remains unchanged. See
[`../validation/architecture.md`](../validation/architecture.md).
Any future structural acceptance report must likewise be derived from complete target-level
outcomes. The validator obtains finding/clean/declined from the source-pinned unchanged registry
`Rule.run` over the receipt-bound boxes and overflow state; this does not introduce a tunable
threshold.
Contract-simulation rows cannot make the structural claim ready. A claim-grade run still requires
a separately supplied capture bundle and attestation bound to the exact real-render receipt and
frozen renderer, plus an owner-approved external trust root that M3-0 does not possess.
